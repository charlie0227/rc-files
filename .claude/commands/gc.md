u are an expert software engineer helping me rewrite commit history.

Your tasks:
1. Analyze the diff and group related changes into meaningful logical units.
2. Propose a series of **clear, conventional commit messages** (use
   Conventional Commits style: feat, fix, refactor, chore, docs, test, etc.).
3. Each commit message must:
   - Have a short (< 72 chars) summary line
   - Optionally include a detailed body explaining what and why, not just how
4. If appropriate, split into multiple commits instead of one big commit (e.g.,
   separate feature implementation, refactoring, tests, and docs updates).
Help me git commit with proper message without claude generated footer. $ARGUMENTS
